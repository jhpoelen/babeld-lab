# Welcome to the mesh (0 to 60 m/hr in 3 seconds)  
Q: What's the mesh? And why do we need one?  
A: The mesh is a decentralized network of computers (or nodes). A mesh is useful because there is no single point of failure. If an individual node goes down, the mesh network will still work. Also, because there is no central node that needs to exist for the network to function, the ownership of the network is shared between all the nodes.

Q: What are nodes? And how do I get one?  
A:  In the peoplesopen.net mesh network, nodes are wireless routers (like Western Digital N600). Normally, these routers are configured to connect a LAN (your local network) to the WAN (the internet) using your ISPs infrastructure. In a mesh configuration, the routers also talk to each other, creating a third network the MAN (municipal area network). This MAN connects nodes that are physically near each other. If you'd like to get a node suitable for the peoplesopen.net, please get a XYZ router and flash it with firmware (see guide below).

Q: Ok, but I want to help out more?  
A: Glad to hear, continue to the roles section below to see how you can get more involved.   

# roles  
Mesh networks don't happen by themselves, they require a ton of effort and a lot of collaboration. If you would like to help out, there are three general roles that anyone (with the right motivation) can fulfill.  
 1. Community Organizer and Educator  
      Are you a people person? Would you like to help our network expand and provide access to those who need it most? Use your social skills to help get the word out. Talk to neighbors and local businesses about setting up a node in their buildings. Help plan events that raise awarness of the mesh. (events, outreach, press, education)  
 2. Technical Support   
      Do you like climbing on roofs? Are you a skilled troubleshooter? Help provided day-to-day management and maintence of the mesh. Assist in the deployment of nodes and roof mounted antennas! (node deployment, troubleshooting, rooftop mounting)  
 3. Software Engineering   
      Are you a hacker or programmer? Do you know how to use github? Fork our repos, modify some code (or just edit a README), maybe we'll make you a contributor. If you'd like fulfill this role, continue to the Educational Guides to learn the technical side of mesh networks and how you can contribute to our many dev projects. (firmware development, monitoring tools)  
 
# software engineering/education  
 
The purpose of this page is to help you get started with decentralized netwo    rking so that you can ready to help improve our firmware (or build your own!    ), maintain the/a network and teach others to do the same.

# educational guides  
If you wish to become involved on a technical level, there are a handful of educational tools that we have developed to help you acquaint yourself with mesh networks and their associated concepts.  
   
 1. (Learn) **Deploy a n-node virtual network ([babeld-lab](https://github.com/sudomesh/babeld-lab))** (once finished) This will help you learn about (and visualize?) the underlying protocol that controls the flow of information on the mesh. If you want to help troubleshoot potential conflicts in the WAN as the mesh grows, this is the guide for you!  
 2. (Build) **Create your own physical node ([build firmware guide](https://github.com/sudomesh/sudowrt-firmware))(makenode also?)**  This will help you learn about the deployment of our custom firmware and its associated hardware. If you want to get involved in the deployment and maintenance of indivdual nodes, want to contribute to the improvement of the firmware or hardware, or just want to deploy your own node, this is the guide for you! This process also registers your node with peoplesopen.net . 
 3. (Teach) **Help a friend or a neighbor work through this guide and grow the mesh network.** This will help build out the mesh and learn about the point-to-point wireless connections that are the backbone of any true mesh network. If you want help build out the mesh in your community or help do the same in other communities, this is the guide for you! 
 4. (Improve) **Help the project evolve** by fixing bugs, developing features, deploying nodes, education your peers and ... perhaps start another mesh network.
