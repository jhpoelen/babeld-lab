# Roles  
Mesh networks don't happen by themselves, they require a ton of effort and a lot of collaboration. If you would like to help out, there are three general roles that anyone (with the right motivation) can fulfill.  
 1. Community Organizer   
      Are you a well connected? Would you like to help make our mesh network more well connected? Use your social skills to help get the word out. Talk to neighbors and local businesses about setting up a node in their buildings. Help plan events that raise awarness of the mesh. (events, outreach, press, education)  
 2. Technical Support   
      Do you like climbing on roofs? Are you a highly skilled troubleshooter. Help provided day to day management and maintence of the mesh. Assist in the deployment of nodes and roof mounted antennas. (node deployment, troubleshooting, rooftop mounting)  
 3. Software Engineering   
      Are you a hacker or programmer? Do you know how to use github? Fork our repos, modify some code (or just edit a README), maybe we'll make you a contributor. If you'd like fulfill this role, continue to the Welcome to the Mesh Guide for more details or the variety of dev projects we have going on. (firmware development, monitoring tools)  
 
# Welcome to the Mesh (software engineering/education)  
 
The purpose of this page is to help you get started with decentralized netwo    rking so that you can ready to help improve our firmware (or build your own!    ), maintain the/a network and teach others to do the same.

# Educational Guides  
If you wish to become involved on a technical level, there are a handful of educational tools that we have developed to help you acquaint yourself with mesh networks and their associated concepts.  
   
 1. Deploy a n-node virtual network (babeld-lab)  
      (once finished) This will help you learn about (and visualize?) the underlying protocol that controls the flow of information on the mesh. If you want to help troubleshoot potential conflicts in the WAN as the mesh grows, this is the guide for you!  
 2. Create your own physical node (build firmware guide)  
      This will help you learn about the deployment of our custom firmware and its associated hardware. If you want to get involved in the deployment and maintanece of indivdual nodes, want to contribute to the improvement of the firmware or hardware, or just want to deploy your own node, this is the guide for you!  
 3. Deploy a two-node physical network  
      This will help build out the mesh and learn about the point-to-point wireless connections that are the backbone of any true mesh network. If you want help build out the mesh in your community or help do the same in other communities, this is the guide for you!
